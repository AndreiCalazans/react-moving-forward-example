# React Moving Forward
--  --  --  --  --  
_This repo is an example of how to use React Hooks and Suspense together. It approaches examples of almost all hook APIs and also displays some other possible integration between them._


## Get started

1) `git clone <repo_url>`
2) `yarn`
3) `yarn start`





**Note:**
_yarn is required, since we are using package.json's resolution feature to override the scheduler's version, npm doesn't provide that._

**Note 2:**
_The app fetches news articles from google news api, I've kept my google api key in the repo to facilitate the usage, however, there is a limit of 1000 requests per day, if you run out jsut create a new account and change the api key below.

* useState
* useEffect
* useContext
* useReducer
* useMemo
* useRef
* useImperativeMethods
* useMutationEffect
* useLayoutEffect
